## Travel Journal
Great morning today. Woke up late and headed to oyster shack with Mayra. She ordered Ostillos which are oysters sources from local PR mangroves and I ordered a lobster roll. I tried some of the oysters and I actually really liked them this time. After that we went to a boutique and got Bella some dresses and a backpack. Stopped at Walgreens then went to a sushi place that was really solid!
