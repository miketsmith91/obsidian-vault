## Vision
- Login optional app? Having an account allows user to get additional features
	- What additional features?
		- Past workouts and other data is backed up to the cloud
		- TBD
- Ability to create custom workouts
	- Bonus: User can upload a spreadsheet template that can get parsed and converted into a workout.
- Custom workouts will be saved but the data the input does not get saved
- Default workouts that can act as "Demoes" of the app

## UI
- 5 button with center button being ciruclar like macrofactor app that is a + sign that adds any data, in this case only the template for now.
- left most button takes them to the workout templates
- next takes them to view past workouts by date?
- 4th button either does the previous one since history kinda makes more sense to the right in my mind
- 5th and right most button is the setting tab
